All good sysadmins are lazy and automated boring stuff.

Run ./setup.bat to setup a new client. This needs admin privileges. It will try to get the required privileges if it was not started accordingly.

For home network probes where the measurements can not be pushed to Elastic directly but need to be copied to an SSH server, run ./user_setup.ps1 as the unprivileged monitoring user.
